## Part A
The main ethical question faced by the main character in this scenario is: "Should you prioritize the company's original commitment to user privacy and data protection as promised to the users, or should you align with the new direction proposed by the CEO which involves potentially compromising user privacy for additional revenue?"

This question encapsulates several underlying ethical considerations:
- Is it ethical to change the use of user data (from solely providing a service to also generating revenue) without explicit consent from the users?
- How should the change in data usage policy be communicated to the users?
- How to balance the ethical responsibility of protecting user privacy with the business interest of generating more revenue?
- What is my responsibility to voice concerns about this shift in data usage, especially considering the CTO's worried look and the company's original vision?
## Part B
- Users of the Beerz App:
    - **Right to Privacy**: Users have the right to have their location and personal data kept private, especially since the app initially promises to discard user data after use.
    - **Right to Informed Consent**: Users have the right to be informed about how their data is used and to consent to any changes in the data usage policy.
- The Company (Beerz):
    - **Right to Conduct Business**: The company has the right to explore new business opportunities and strategies, including potential revenue streams.
    - **Right to Modify Product Offerings**: The company has the right to develop and modify its app features and services, within legal and ethical boundaries.
- CEO of Beerz:
    - **Right to Pursue Profit**: As the CEO, they have the right to pursue strategies that increase the company’s profitability.
- CTO of Beerz:
    - **Right to Uphold Company Values and Ethics**: The CTO has the right, and possibly the obligation, to uphold the company’s original values and ethical commitments, especially regarding data privacy.
- Development Team (Including me):
    - **Right to Work in an Ethical Environment**: Team members have the right to work in an environment that respects ethical practices and aligns with their professional values.
    - **Right to Voice Concerns**: Team members have the right to express concerns about projects or directives that conflict with their professional ethics or the company’s stated values.
## Part C
- Beerz App's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
- Opinions from other team members.
- Background and intentions of Beerz App's investors.
## Part D
Align with CEO's New Direction:
	- **Action**: Develop the new features without data-scrubbing and follow CEO's decision to profit on anonymized location data
	- **Consequences**: Developing new features without data-scrubbing and monetizing anonymized location data risks user privacy breaches, potential legal issues, and erosion of trust in the company.
Advocate for User Privacy:
    - **Action**: Speak up for the importance of user privacy, referencing the original company vision and ethical considerations.
    - **Consequences**: This could either strengthen the company's commitment to user privacy and ethical practices, or it might put you at odds with the CEO and others who are interested in monetizing data. It could also influence the company culture positively by emphasizing ethical practices.
Propose a Compromise:
    - **Action**: Suggest a middle ground, such as using aggregated data instead of individual user data, ensuring better anonymization, or seeking explicit user consent for data usage.
    - **Consequences**: This may satisfy both the business objectives and ethical concerns to some extent. However, it might not fully address the privacy concerns or the potential for revenue generation as desired by the CEO.
## Part E
1.2 - Avoid Harms: This principle emphasizes the importance of avoiding harm to others. In the context of the scenario, this would mean considering the potential harms of misusing user location data, such as privacy violations or unauthorized data sharing.

1.3 - Be Honest and Trustworthy: This principle underlines the importance of honesty and integrity. Given the company's original pitch about valuing user privacy and avoiding surveillance capitalism, it would be ethically important to remain transparent and truthful about how user data is used.

1.6 - Respect Privacy: The ACM Code specifically highlights respecting privacy, which is directly relevant in this scenario. It suggests that you should advocate for protecting user data and be cautious about changes that might infringe on user privacy.
## Part F
My recommended action is to advocate for user privacy while proposing a compromise that includes strict data anonymization and explicit user consent. This approach respects the ethical obligation to protect user privacy and aligns with the company's original vision, yet it doesn't entirely dismiss the possibility of generating additional revenue through data.

Answers for questions in Part A:
- Is it ethical to change the use of user data (from solely providing a service to also generating revenue) without explicit consent from the users?
	- No, it is not ethical. Users' data should be used only in ways they have explicitly consented to. Changing the use of data without their informed consent violates user trust and privacy rights.
- How should the change in data usage policy be communicated to the users?
	- Changes should be communicated transparently and directly, such as through email notifications, app updates, or a clear statement in the app. Users should be given detailed information and the choice to opt-in or opt-out.
- How to balance the ethical responsibility of protecting user privacy with the business interest of generating more revenue?
	- Balance can be achieved by seeking explicit user consent for additional data uses, implementing robust anonymization techniques, and ensuring any data monetization is transparent and aligns with user expectations and privacy laws.
- What is my responsibility to voice concerns about this shift in data usage, especially considering the CTO's worried look and the company's original vision?
	- It's my responsibility to voice concerns, highlighting the potential risks to user trust and the company's reputation. This aligns with maintaining the company's ethical standards and respecting the vision shared by the CTO.
